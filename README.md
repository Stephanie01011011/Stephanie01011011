Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! I graduated from IU Indianapolis in May 2024 with my B.S in Informatics and a certificate in Human Computer Interactions. If you are unsure what Informatics entails, it is a great mixture of: 

* Computer Science
* Business
* Database management
* User Experience research/design 

I started college wanting to get into web development but when I took my first database class I fell in love with writing queries and takiing raw data and turning it into intelligence. 

My first internship my role was as web developer and designer, which turned into being a social media manager for the company. I used excel to keep track of all social media data, vendor data, and client data. Data cleansing and pivot tables were a large part of my daily routine here.

My current role as web and data support allows me to clean company data, automate marketing data for the sales team, and use excel functions such as VLOOKUP to deliver intelligence to the marketing and sales team.
